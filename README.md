### Hello, stranger! ðŸ™‚

My name is Pelayo de las Heras and I am a **junior full-stack web developer**. After years working as a journalist for several magazines I discovered that I enjoyed coding: the possibility of giving a bit of shape to the digital landscape was beautiful. With the knowledge I acquired from Le Wagon I try to design new websites and solve real problems. All through code!

- ðŸŒ± Always open to learn new technologies
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, from coding to cooking!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I write code, but also fiction
